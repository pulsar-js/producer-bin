# @pulsar-js/producer (binaries)

This repository houses the pre-built binaries for the [@pulsar/producer](https://github.com/pulsar-js/producer) npm module.

Since this is a niche module, we are only building binaries for the platforms we know users are working with. If you want to use this on one of the operating systems/architectures listed above that isn't yet supported, open an issue and we'll add it.
